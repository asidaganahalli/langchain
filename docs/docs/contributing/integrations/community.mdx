# Contribute Community Integrations

:::info
Before beginning, make sure you have read about the different types of integrations in the [Contributing Integrations](./index.mdx) guide.
:::

## What is a community integration

Community integrations live in the `langchain-community` package and are maintained by the community.

The `langchain-community` package is released by LangChain at least once every 7 days, and it contains
integrations and implementations of the interfaces defined in the `langchain-core` package.

## Why contribute a community integration

If you are a company that wants to integrate with LangChain, you can contribute a community integration to:

- Make it easy for users to use your product with LangChain
- Quickly enable use cases that require multiple products
- Allow LangChain users to try out your product with their existing project (e.g. 
if you host a chat model, users can try yours out to compare the experience with 
their current model)

If you are a user of any service, we also welcome your contributions to community integrations!
Service users often have some of the best insights into how to use a service, and your contributions
can help other users get started with the service in as smooth a way as possible.

## How to contribute a community integration

In the following sections, we'll walk through how to contribute a chat model from a fake company, `Parrot Link AI`.

### 1. Fork and clone the repository

First, let's fork the [LangChain Repository](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) 
into a personal account fork, **not an organization fork** ([why?](/docs/contributing/faq/#how-do-i-allow-maintainers-to-edit-my-pr)).

You can fork the repository [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/fork), and if you are prompted to "Choose an owner," select your personal username.

Now, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/langchain.git
```

The `langchain-community` package is in `libs/community` and contains most integrations.

It can be installed with `pip install langchain-community`, and exported members can be imported with code like 

```python
from langchain_community.chat_models import ChatParrotLink
from langchain_community.llms import ParrotLinkLLM
from langchain_community.vectorstores import ParrotLinkVectorStore
```

The `community` package relies on manually-installed dependent packages, so you will see errors 
if you try to import a package that is not installed. In our fake example, if you tried to import `ParrotLinkLLM` without installing `parrot-link-sdk`, you will see an `ImportError` telling you to install it when trying to use it.

Let's say we wanted to implement a chat model for Parrot Link AI. We would create a new file in `libs/community/langchain_community/chat_models/parrot_link.py` with the following code:

```python
from langchain_core.language_models.chat_models import BaseChatModel

class ChatParrotLink(BaseChatModel):
    """ChatParrotLink chat model.

    Example:
        .. code-block:: python

            from langchain_community.chat_models import ChatParrotLink

            model = ChatParrotLink()
    """

    ...
```

And we would write tests in:

- Unit tests: `libs/community/tests/unit_tests/chat_models/test_parrot_link.py`
- Integration tests: `libs/community/tests/integration_tests/chat_models/test_parrot_link.py`

And add documentation to:

- `docs/docs/integrations/chat/parrot_link.ipynb`
