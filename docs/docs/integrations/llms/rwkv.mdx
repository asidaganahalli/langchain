# RWKV-4

>[RWKV](https://www.rwkv.com/) (pronounced RwaKuv) language model is an RNN 
> with GPT-level LLM performance, 
> and it can also be directly trained like a GPT transformer (parallelizable).
>
>It's combining the best of RNN and transformer - great performance, fast inference, 
> fast training, saves VRAM, "infinite" ctxlen, and free text embedding. 
> Moreover it's 100% attention-free, and a LFAI project.


## Installation and Setup

- Install the Python `rwkv` and `tokenizer` packages

```bash
pip install rwkv tokenizer
```

- Download a [RWKV model](https://huggingface.co/BlinkDL/rwkv-4-raven/tree/main) and place it in your desired directory
- Download a [tokens file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlinkDL/ChatRWKV/main/20B_tokenizer.json)

### Rwkv-4 models recommended VRAM

| Model | 8bit | bf16/fp16 | fp32 |
|-------|------|-----------|------|
| 14B   | 16GB | 28GB      | >50GB |
| 7B    | 8GB  | 14GB      | 28GB |
| 3B    | 2.8GB| 6GB       | 12GB |
| 1b5   | 1.3GB| 3GB       | 6GB |

See the [rwkv pip](https://pypi.org/project/rwkv/) page for more information about strategies, 
including streaming and CUDA support.

## Usage

### RWKV

To use the RWKV wrapper, you need to provide the path to the pre-trained model file and the tokenizer's configuration.
```python
from langchain_community.llms import RWKV

# Test the model

```python

def generate_prompt(instruction, input=None):
    if input:
        return f"""Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

# Instruction:
{instruction}

# Input:
{input}

# Response:
"""
    else:
        return f"""Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

# Instruction:
{instruction}

# Response:
"""


model = RWKV(model="./models/RWKV-4-Raven-3B-v7-Eng-20230404-ctx4096.pth", strategy="cpu fp32", tokens_path="./rwkv/20B_tokenizer.json")
response = model.invoke(generate_prompt("Once upon a time, "))
```
