# AskNews

>[AskNews](https://asknews.app/) infuses any LLM with the latest global news 
> (or historical news), using a single natural language query. Specifically, 
> `AskNews` is enriching over 300k articles per day by translating, summarizing, 
> extracting entities, and indexing them into hot and cold vector databases. 
> `AskNews` puts these vector databases on a low-latency endpoint for you. 
> When you query `AskNews`, you get back a prompt-optimized string that contains all 
> the most pertinent enrichments (e.g. entities, classifications, translation, summarization). 
> This means that you do not need to manage your own news RAG, and you do not need to 
> worry about how to properly convey news information in a condensed way to your LLM. 
> [AskNews]() is also committed to transparency, which is why our coverage is monitored 
> and diversified across hundreds of countries, 13 languages, and 50 thousand sources. 
> If you'd like to track our source coverage, you can visit our transparency dashboard.
